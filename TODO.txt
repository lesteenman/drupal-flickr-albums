Fix basic syncing. ISSUE: counting the total synced photos and videos.

Write tests to verify syncing continues to work.
- Figure out correct code style for tests.
- Write tests for:
  - Syncing (write mocks for this)
  - Small batches
  - Larger batches
  - 0-size batches
  - Batches that are over the size of the amount of photos available
  - Using cron

Rename FLickrAlbumsApi to something more sensible for something
  that gets shit out of the database.

Continue moving shit to classes/services and decouple everything.
Figure out if this is actually the correct pattern for a ServiceContainer.

Continue on frontend code once syncing works.

Write tests for:
- Clientside correct showing
- Install/Uninstall

Move to a class or similar:
Controller?
- flickr_albums_preprocess_photo
- flickr_albums_preprocess_album_teaser
- flickr_albums_preprocess_album

Properly fix the hook_requirements

Bonus:
Figure out how to easily set up a completely clean installation for testing.
Figure out if we can use phpUnit in any useful way
Attempt to set up a code sniffer & test runner
