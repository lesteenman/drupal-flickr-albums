# Flickr Albums
Introduction: what is this module meant to do?

Main essence:
- Use Flickr to externally host a photo album, and show them on your Drupal website.
- Includes commenting.
- Includes video support.
- Allows to set different permissions for private or public photos.
- Does not actually import the media itself in your website, but saves a reference to the Flickr media.

A browser for a user's Flickr album in Drupal. Allows comments on photos or albums, a separation of permissions for private and public photos, and a block to show new activity in photo albums.

# This module features
A short list of all individual features. Here's a start:
- View a list of a user's albums

# Other Flickr modules
There are a number of other Flickr modules for Drupal. However, it seems that most lacked support for video, different permissions based on the original media permissions, or commenting. I haven't seen any modules that combine all of these in the way this module does.

However, they serve certain purposes better than this module. Here are a few:
- Flickr (https://www.drupal.org/project/flickr). This is a great module if you simply want to embed individual photos from Flickr on your website, or if you want to show photos based on search terms, rather than one user's photos.
- Flickrgallery (https://www.drupal.org/project/flickrgallery). This module also supports showing a single user's albums, similar to this module, but lacks support for comments or a separation of permissions. I'm not certain if it supports video or not at this point.
